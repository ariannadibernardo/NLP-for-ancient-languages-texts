 Writing texts in the Middle Ages required sticking to specific rules of composition. The variety of medieval rhetoric that provided instruction in the composition of letters and documents is referred as ars dictandi, deriving from the latin verb dictare - "to compose". The term was used during the Middle Ages to designate any type of composition, and it was based on the assumpion that authors had to compose their texts in line to well worked models.

According to this premise, it would be useful to detect the sources of a certain latin text, in order to infer its historical age or the authors whose writing style is similar. In fact, there exist a lot of anonymous documents that could be matched with the most likely author to obtain more specific basic information about the context. Possibility to match certain document to its historical age or the most similar authors would allow an understanding of a wider historical and cultural context as well as give a deeper insight into international relations.

We aim to investigate the implementation of a general pipeline to extract qualitative and quantitative information 
from Latin texts employing ML algorithms. In particular, our approach focuses on detecting similarities in the text and between them. That could be helpful for 
historians and linguists to investigate some features of a text. For instance, it could be beneficial to classify authors according to writing styles or historical ages, as well as to recognize the author of anonymous documents with a certain probability. 

Finally, we propose a network representation that aims to capture and represent these similarities, and we quantify the degree of relationship by computing a similarity index.
